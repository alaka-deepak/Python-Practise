    "<li> python ---> want to communicate with the processor(CPython is the interpreter)\n",
    "<li>  How does the for-loop work? \n",

    "            The for-loop executes the indented lines n-times, where n is the number of items in the list that is being iterated. \n",

    "<li> What is the difference between a while loop and a for-loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "             A while loop iterates as long as the while-condition is True. A for-loop iterates that many times as there are items in the list that is being iterated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> What are some other examples when we would need to use a for-loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "            A for-loop is generally needed when you want to perform the same manipulation on multiple objects (e.g., capitalizing strings of a list). Another example of when you would need to use a for-loop is if you wanted to convert a video to grayscale. A video is made of hundreds or thousands of image frames. You would need to use a for-loop to iterate over the video frames and apply a grayscale effect to each frame. Another example would be to iterate over the pages of your blog website to extract their user comments, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> What is the difference between match-case and if-else?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Match-case is usually to match a string out of a predefined number of strings (e.g., a series of commands, months of the year, etc.).  If-else conditionals check more complex conditions. We will cover if-else conditionals later in the course. There you will understand the exact difference."
